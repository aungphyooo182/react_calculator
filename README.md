# react_calculator
Educational Project From YouTube Course

In this project I will be creating a simple calculator in React that handles input changes, user interaction, and complex calculations. This is the perfect project for anyone getting started in React since it focuses on some of the most important React concepts, such as re-renders, state management, and breaking down your code into components.

Bottom line : Calculation logics were not being used from library.
